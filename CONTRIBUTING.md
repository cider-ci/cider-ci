Contributing to Cider-CI
========================

Vision for Evolution
--------------------

There is a clear vision of what features Cider-CI will and will not support
in the future.

SCM and Pull Requests
---------------------

The _master_ branch has a stable history. All other branches are subject 
to rebasing etc.

A pull request should be a single commit on top of the most recent commit
of the _master_ branch.

Contributor Licence Agreement
-----------------------------

Pull requests will only be considered if you sign a contributor licence
agreement. It is similar to the ones used for [Neo4J][] ([Neo4j CLA][])
or [MongoDB][] ([10gen CLA][]) for example.
