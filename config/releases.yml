    # New Features

    * The load for a task can now be set. It used to be the fixed value one.
      This is not to overload the executors, or not use them efficiently,
      when there are tasks causing different loads.

    * The new directive `read_and_replace_with` will read an arbitrary file
      from the source code and include it as as string value in the project
      configuration. This can be used e.g. to set environment variables.

    * Add a new project configuration directive: `read_and_replace_with`, see
      <https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci_demo-project-bash/commit/273687ebe027e1bd23e00671606256232a46ff1c>.

    * Support :generate_tasks for submodules officially. Make :generate_tasks
      easier and less obscure to debug by defer generation from delivering
      the project configuration to to the point when the project specification is
      generated.


    # Other Changes and fixes

    * Executor: Fix mangling of environment variables.
